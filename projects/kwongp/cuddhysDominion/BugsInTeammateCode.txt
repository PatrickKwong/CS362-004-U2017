------------------------------
Steps to Produce/Reproduce Bug
------------------------------
1. Start a Dominion game
2. Acquire a Adventurer card
4. Examine and note the number of cards in discard pile
3. Play the Adventurer card
4. Examine and note that the number of cards in discard pile is much more than drawn.

The player should only have discarded the number of cards drawn while looking for the 2 treasure cards 
and the Adventurer card after playing it.


Actual Results
--------------
The player has still has the Adventurer card in hand and discard many more cards than those drawn while
looking for the 2 treasure cards.


Other Information
-----------------
This bug occurs on line 655 of dominion.c, within the adventurerFunc function. 
	z = 99;

The z is counter for the temp cards. However, it seem that right before counting begins on the cards drawn while lookign for the 2 treasure cards, the z is assigned a value of 99 before anything is even counted.

This bug was discovered with cardtest1.c and randomtestadventurer.c where the user ends up with much more cards discarded than drawn while looking for 2 treasure cards. This was confirmed with test results and examination of code.

Bug Report #3

Title: Smithy Card Hangs Game
Code: dominion.c
Code Author: Shawn Cuddhy (cuddhys)
Author Email: cuddhys@oregonstate.edu

Class: Major Bug

Date: 8/2/2017
Tester: Patrick Kwong (kwongp)
Tester Email: kwongp@oregonstate.edu

Product: Dominion game
Platform: Windows 7

Is it reproducible: Yes

---------------
Bug Description
---------------
When a player plays the Smithy card, the game gets stuck and hangs.

------------------------------
Steps to Produce/Reproduce Bug
------------------------------
1. Start a Dominion game
2. Acquire a Smithy card
3. Play the Smithy card
4. Note that game gets stuck and hangs. 

----------------
Expected Results
----------------
The player should have drawn 3 cards and discard the Smithy card after playing it.


Actual Results
--------------
The player get stuck after playing the Smithy card.


Other Information
-----------------
This bug occurs on line 681 of dominion.c, within the smithyFunc function. 
    for (i = 0; i < 3; i)
	{
	  drawCard(currentPlayer, state)
	}

The bug is caused by the i at the end of the for loop not being incremented with ++. This bug causes the player to get stuck in a infinite loop continuing to run drawCard and never get out of the for loop becuase i is never going to be < 3.

This bug was discovered with cardtest2.c and randomtestcard1.c when the bug caused my tests to hang forever. This bug was confirmed with an examination of code.
